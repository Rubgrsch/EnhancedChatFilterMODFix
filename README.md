# EnhancedChatFilterMODFix
EnhancedChatFilter, a WoW chat addon, modded for Chinese users

Description
-----------

This is a WoW chat filter addon mainly for chinese servers.<br />
It is now supporting Legion(7.1.0).<br />
这是一个主要适用于国服魔兽世界的聊天屏蔽插件。<br />
现已更新至军团再临(7.1.0)。<br />

The original project, which is abondoned, can be found here: <http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/chat-filter/><br />
And it has already been localized: <http://bbs.ngacn.cc/read.php?tid=7527032> by szpunk.<br />
However in patch 6.2.4, some APIs have been removed. so I decided to fix those errors.<br />
Also many bugs were fixed and some new features have been added compared to the localized one.<br />
Please delete old config folders(in WTF) if you were using the old one(before 6.2.4).<br />
相比于原版更新到了6.2.4的API并修复许多错误，有新的功能。<br />
如果你使用的是6.2.4之前的版本请删除配置文件(在WTF里面)再使用。<br />

English locale has been added. Test and feed back are welcome.<br />
However usage is still in Chinese. You may google translate the chinese versoin for now.<br />
Need some help for english version wiki.<br />
General issues and pull requests are also welcome.<br />
