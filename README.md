The original project, which is abondoned, can be found here: <http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/chat-filter/>  
And it has already been localized: <http://bbs.ngacn.cc/read.php?tid=7527032> by szpunk.  
However in patch 6.2.4, some APIs have been removed. so I decided to fix those errors.  
Also many bugs were fixed and some new features have been added compared to the localized one.  
Please delete old config folders(in WTF) if you were using the old one(before 6.2.4).  
相比于原版更新到了6.2.4的API并修复许多错误，有新的功能。  
如果你使用的是6.2.4之前的版本请删除配置文件(在WTF里面)再使用。  

English locale has been added. Test and feed back are welcome.  
However usage is still in Chinese. You may google translate the chinese versoin for now.  
Need some help for english version wiki.  
General issues and pull requests are also welcome.
